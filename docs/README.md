# Building Effective LLM Agents

This documentation provides comprehensive guidance on building effective Large Language Model (LLM) agents, based on practical experience and best practices from production implementations.

## Core Concepts

### What are Agents?

We categorize agentic systems into two main types:

- **Workflows**: Systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths
- **Agents**: Systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage

## When to Use Agents

Consider the following guidelines:

1. Start with the simplest solution possible
2. Only increase complexity when demonstrably needed
3. Consider the tradeoff between latency/cost and task performance
4. Use workflows for predictability and consistency
5. Use agents for flexibility and model-driven decision-making

## Agent Patterns

We've documented several proven agent patterns:

1. [Prompt Chaining](patterns/prompt-chaining.md)
2. [Routing](patterns/routing.md)
3. [Parallelization](patterns/parallelization.md)
4. [Orchestrator-Workers](patterns/orchestrator-workers.md)
5. [Evaluator-Optimizer](patterns/evaluator-optimizer.md)
6. [Autonomous Agent](patterns/autonomous-agent.md)

## Best Practices

### Core Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Maintain simplicity in your agent's design
2. **Transparency**: Show the agent's planning steps explicitly
3. **Interface Design**: Carefully craft your agent-computer interface (ACI)

### Tool Engineering

1. Give models enough tokens to "think" before writing
2. Keep formats close to naturally occurring text
3. Avoid formatting overhead (line counting, string escaping)
4. Provide clear documentation and examples
5. Test and iterate on tool usage
6. Design tools to prevent common mistakes

### Implementation Guidelines

1. Start with direct API usage before adopting frameworks
2. Understand the underlying code of any frameworks used
3. Test extensively in sandboxed environments
4. Implement appropriate guardrails
5. Monitor performance and costs

## Practical Applications

### Customer Support
- Natural conversation flow with tool integration
- Access to customer data and knowledge bases
- Programmatic actions (refunds, tickets)
- Clear success metrics

### Coding Tasks
- Verifiable through automated tests
- Iteration based on test feedback
- Well-defined problem space
- Objective quality metrics

## Getting Started

1. Review the [agent patterns](patterns/) documentation
2. Check our [example implementations](../agents/)
3. Follow the [setup guides](setup/) for each pattern
4. Consult the [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md)
