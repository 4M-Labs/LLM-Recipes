# Parallelization Agent Pattern

The Parallelization Agent pattern is designed to efficiently distribute tasks across multiple LLM calls simultaneously, enabling parallel processing of complex operations while respecting task dependencies.

## Overview

This pattern is particularly useful when you need to:
- Process large amounts of data or content in parallel
- Break down complex tasks into independent subtasks
- Handle tasks with specific dependency requirements
- Optimize processing time through parallel execution

## Features

- **Parallel Task Processing**: Execute multiple LLM calls simultaneously
- **Dependency Management**: Handle task dependencies gracefully
- **Result Aggregation**: Combine results from multiple subtasks coherently
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and reporting
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor task completion and token usage
- **Flexible Worker Configuration**: Adapt model parameters based on task type

## Implementation

The pattern is implemented in both Python (`parallelization_agent.py`) and JavaScript (`parallelization-agent.js`).

### Key Components

1. **SubTask Definition**:
   ```python
   {
       "id": "task_id",
       "type": "task_type",
       "content": "task_description",
       "dependencies": ["dependent_task_ids"]
   }
   ```

2. **Task Processing**:
   - Tasks are processed in parallel when their dependencies are satisfied
   - Each task is processed using an appropriate model configuration
   - Results include task output and metadata

3. **Result Aggregation**:
   - Results from parallel tasks are collected and organized
   - A final synthesis combines all results into a coherent output

## Usage

### Python
```python
from parallelization_agent import parallel_process

task = "Analyze a research paper"
subtasks = [
    {
        "id": "methodology",
        "type": "analysis",
        "content": "Analyze methodology section",
        "dependencies": []
    },
    {
        "id": "results",
        "type": "analysis",
        "content": "Analyze results section",
        "dependencies": []
    },
    {
        "id": "discussion",
        "type": "analysis",
        "content": "Analyze discussion",
        "dependencies": ["methodology", "results"]
    }
]

result = await parallel_process(task, subtasks)
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
import { parallelProcess } from './parallelization-agent.js';

const task = "Analyze a research paper";
const subtasks = [
    {
        id: "methodology",
        type: "analysis",
        content: "Analyze methodology section",
        dependencies: []
    },
    {
        id: "results",
        type: "analysis",
        content: "Analyze results section",
        dependencies: []
    },
    {
        id: "discussion",
        type: "analysis",
        content: "Analyze discussion",
        dependencies: ["methodology", "results"]
    }
];

const result = await parallelProcess(task, subtasks);
```

## Dependencies

### Python
- openai
- termcolor
- typing-extensions

### JavaScript
- openai
- termcolor

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Python
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # JavaScript
   npm install openai termcolor
   ```

2. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Task Granularity**: Break down tasks into appropriate sizes - not too small (overhead) or too large (inefficient)
2. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependency chains minimal to maximize parallelization
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for task failures
4. **Resource Management**: Monitor token usage and costs
5. **Model Selection**: Use appropriate models for different task types

## Example Use Cases

1. **Document Analysis**:
   - Analyze different sections of a document in parallel
   - Combine analyses into a comprehensive summary

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Process multiple data points or records simultaneously
   - Aggregate results into a unified dataset

3. **Content Generation**:
   - Generate multiple content pieces in parallel
   - Ensure consistency across generated content

4. **Research Tasks**:
   - Conduct multiple research subtasks simultaneously
   - Synthesize findings into a coherent report

## Error Handling

The pattern includes robust error handling for:
- Circular dependencies
- Invalid task configurations
- API failures
- Task processing errors

## Performance Considerations

- Monitor token usage per task
- Balance parallelization with API rate limits
- Consider task dependencies when organizing workloads
- Use appropriate model sizes for different task types
