# Routing Agent Pattern

The Routing Agent pattern involves using an LLM to analyze input and intelligently route it to the most appropriate specialized agent, model, or processing pathway. This allows for more efficient handling of diverse inputs by directing them to the most suitable handler.

## When to Use This Pattern

Use the Routing Agent pattern when:

- Your system needs to handle diverse types of inputs or requests
- Different types of inputs require different specialized processing
- You want to optimize resource usage by using simpler models for simpler tasks
- You need to dynamically adjust system behavior based on input classification

## Implementation

A Routing Agent implementation typically involves:

1. A classification step where the input is analyzed and categorized
2. A routing decision based on the classification
3. Specialized handlers for each category of input

## Example Implementation

See [routing-agent.ts](./routing-agent.ts) for a TypeScript implementation and [routing_agent.py](./routing_agent.py) for a Python implementation.

```typescript
// Basic structure of a routing agent implementation
async function routeAndProcess(input: string) {
  // Step 1: Classify the input
  const classification = await classifyInput(input);
  
  // Step 2: Route based on classification
  switch(classification.type) {
    case 'technical':
      return await technicalSupportAgent(input);
    case 'billing':
      return await billingAgent(input);
    case 'general':
      return await generalInformationAgent(input);
    default:
      return await fallbackAgent(input);
  }
}
```

## Considerations

- **Classification Accuracy**: The effectiveness of routing depends on accurate classification
- **Overhead**: Classification adds an extra step, which increases latency and cost
- **Error Handling**: Consider what happens if classification fails or is ambiguous
- **Feedback Loop**: Monitor routing decisions and adjust as needed

## Variations

1. **Hierarchical Routing**: Multiple levels of classification for more complex workflows
2. **Confidence-Based Routing**: Routing decisions that account for model confidence
3. **Hybrid Routing**: Combining rule-based and LLM-based routing decisions
4. **Multi-Dimensional Routing**: Routing based on multiple factors (e.g., content type, complexity, urgency)

## Related Patterns

- **Prompt Chaining**: Often used after routing to a specific pathway
- **Tool Usage**: Different tools may be selected based on routing decisions
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Routing can determine which specialized agent handles a request
