# Orchestrator-Workers Agent Pattern

The Orchestrator-Workers pattern implements a coordinated system where a central orchestrator LLM directs multiple specialized worker LLMs to perform complex tasks. This pattern is ideal for managing complex workflows that require different types of expertise and coordination.

## Overview

This pattern excels in scenarios requiring:
- Complex task decomposition and coordination
- Specialized processing by different types of workers
- Dependency management between subtasks
- Result synthesis and quality control

## Features

- **Smart Task Planning**: Automatic task breakdown and dependency mapping
- **Specialized Workers**: Different worker types for various task aspects
- **Dynamic Task Assignment**: Intelligent worker selection based on task type
- **Result Coordination**: Proper handling of task dependencies and results
- **Quality Control**: Validation of intermediate and final results
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Track progress, performance, and resource usage

## Implementation

Available in both Python (`orchestrator_workers.py`) and JavaScript (`orchestrator-workers.js`).

### Key Components

1. **Worker Types**:
   - Researcher: Information gathering and analysis
   - Synthesizer: Information combination and summarization
   - Validator: Output verification and quality control
   - Specialist: Domain-specific task execution

2. **Task Structure**:
   ```python
   {
       "id": "task_id",
       "type": "worker_type",
       "input": "task_description",
       "context": {"relevant_context": "data"},
       "requirements": ["requirement1", "requirement2"]
   }
   ```

3. **Execution Flow**:
   - Task Planning
   - Worker Assignment
   - Dependency Resolution
   - Result Synthesis

## Usage

### Python
```python
from orchestrator_workers import orchestrate_task

goal = """Create a market analysis report for a new smartphone app,
including target audience analysis, competitor research, and pricing strategy."""

result = orchestrate_task(goal)
print(result['final_output'])
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
import { orchestrateTask } from './orchestrator-workers.js';

const goal = `Create a market analysis report for a new smartphone app,
including target audience analysis, competitor research, and pricing strategy.`;

const result = await orchestrateTask(goal);
console.log(result.finalOutput);
```

## Dependencies

### Python
- openai
- termcolor
- typing-extensions

### JavaScript
- openai
- termcolor

## Installation

1. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   # Python
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # JavaScript
   npm install openai termcolor
   ```

2. Configure your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Task Definition**:
   - Clear, specific task descriptions
   - Well-defined requirements
   - Appropriate context provision

2. **Worker Selection**:
   - Match worker types to task requirements
   - Consider task complexity when selecting models
   - Balance capability with efficiency

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Clear dependency specification
   - Avoid circular dependencies
   - Minimize unnecessary dependencies

4. **Result Handling**:
   - Proper error handling
   - Comprehensive result validation
   - Clear success criteria

## Example Use Cases

1. **Market Research**:
   - Researcher workers gather market data
   - Specialist workers analyze specific sectors
   - Synthesizer workers combine findings
   - Validator workers ensure quality

2. **Content Creation**:
   - Researchers gather information
   - Specialists create specific content
   - Synthesizers ensure consistency
   - Validators check quality

3. **Technical Analysis**:
   - Specialists analyze different aspects
   - Researchers gather supporting data
   - Synthesizers combine analyses
   - Validators verify technical accuracy

4. **Strategic Planning**:
   - Researchers analyze current state
   - Specialists propose strategies
   - Synthesizers create cohesive plan
   - Validators assess feasibility

## Advanced Features

1. **Dynamic Worker Configuration**:
   - Model selection based on task complexity
   - Temperature adjustment for different tasks
   - Context management for better results

2. **Progress Monitoring**:
   - Task completion tracking
   - Token usage monitoring
   - Performance metrics

3. **Error Recovery**:
   - Graceful failure handling
   - Task retry mechanisms
   - Result validation

## Performance Optimization

- **Resource Management**:
  - Efficient token usage
  - Appropriate model selection
  - Optimal task batching

- **Quality Control**:
  - Input validation
  - Output verification
  - Consistency checks

- **Scalability**:
