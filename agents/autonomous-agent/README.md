# Autonomous Agent Pattern

The Autonomous Agent pattern involves creating an agent that can operate independently to achieve goals through a continuous cycle of perception, reasoning, and action. This agent interacts with its environment, makes decisions based on observations, and takes actions to accomplish tasks with minimal human intervention.

## When to Use This Pattern

Use the Autonomous Agent pattern when:

- Tasks require continuous interaction with an environment
- Goals can be achieved through a series of actions determined at runtime
- The agent needs to adapt to changing conditions or feedback
- Long-running processes need to be managed autonomously
- Complex decision-making is required based on environmental state

## Implementation

An Autonomous Agent implementation typically involves:

1. A perception system that observes the environment
2. A reasoning component that processes observations and determines actions
3. An action system that executes decisions and affects the environment
4. A feedback loop that evaluates the results of actions
5. A memory system to maintain context and learn from past interactions

## Example Implementation

See [autonomous-agent.ts](./autonomous-agent.ts) for a TypeScript implementation and [autonomous_agent.py](./autonomous_agent.py) for a Python implementation.

```typescript
// Basic structure of an autonomous agent pattern implementation
class AutonomousAgent {
  private memory: Memory;
  private environment: Environment;
  
  constructor(environment: Environment) {
    this.memory = new Memory();
    this.environment = environment;
  }
  
  async run(goal: string): Promise<ActionResult> {
    // Initialize the agent with a goal
    this.memory.setGoal(goal);
    let isComplete = false;
    
    // Main agent loop
    while (!isComplete) {
      // 1. Observe the environment
      const observation = await this.environment.observe();
      
      // 2. Update memory with new observation
      this.memory.addObservation(observation);
      
      // 3. Reason about the current state and determine next action
      const action = await this.reason();
      
      // 4. Execute the action in the environment
      const result = await this.environment.executeAction(action);
      
      // 5. Process feedback and determine if goal is complete
      this.memory.addActionResult(action, result);
      isComplete = this.evaluateCompletion(result);
      
      // Optional: Stop if maximum iterations reached
      if (this.memory.iterations > MAX_ITERATIONS) break;
    }
    
    return this.memory.getFinalResult();
  }
  
  private async reason(): Promise<Action> {
    // Use LLM to determine the next best action based on memory and goal
    return await determineNextAction(this.memory);
  }
  
  private evaluateCompletion(result: ActionResult): boolean {
    // Determine if the goal has been achieved
    return result.status === 'success' && result.goalAchieved;
  }
}
```

## Considerations

- **Action Space**: Define a clear set of actions the agent can take
- **Observation Clarity**: Ensure the agent can perceive relevant aspects of the environment
- **Goal Specification**: Provide clear, measurable goals for the agent
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Implement constraints to prevent harmful actions
- **Termination Conditions**: Define clear criteria for when the agent should stop
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of unexpected situations or failures

## Variations

1. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Multiple autonomous agents collaborating or competing
2. **Hierarchical Agents**: Agents with different levels of abstraction and responsibility
3. **Learning Agents**: Agents that improve their performance over time
4. **Specialized Agents**: Agents designed for specific domains or tasks

## Related Patterns

- **Evaluator-Optimizer**: Can be used to improve the agent's actions
- **Orchestrator-Workers**: Autonomous agents can serve as orchestrators
- **Tool Usage**: Agents often use tools to interact with their environment
