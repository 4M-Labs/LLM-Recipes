### Agent Patterns

Production-ready agent implementations:

- **[Autonomous Agent](agents/autonomous-agent/)** - Self-directed task execution
- **[Evaluator-Optimizer](agents/evaluator-optimizer/)** - Self-improving systems
- **[Orchestrator-Workers](agents/orchestrator-workers/)** - Coordinated multi-agent systems
- **[Parallelization](agents/parallelization/)** - Concurrent processing
- **[Prompt Chaining](agents/prompt-chaining/)** - Sequential task decomposition
- **[Routing](agents/routing/)** - Intelligent task distribution

### Prompting Techniques

Advanced strategies for optimal LLM interaction:

- **[Chain of Thought](prompting-techniques/chain-of-thought.md)** - Step-by-step reasoning
- **[Few-Shot Prompting](prompting-techniques/few-shot-prompting.md)** - Learning from examples
- **[ReAct Prompting](prompting-techniques/react-prompting.md)** - Reasoning and acting
- **[Role Prompting](prompting-techniques/role-prompting.md)** - Persona-based interactions
- **[Self-Consistency](prompting-techniques/self-consistency.md)** - Multiple reasoning paths
- **[Tree of Thoughts](prompting-techniques/tree-of-thoughts.md)** - Branching reasoning paths
- **[Zero-Shot Prompting](prompting-techniques/zero-shot-prompting.md)** - No-example inference
