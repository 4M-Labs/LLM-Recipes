### Agent Recipes

Our agent recipes provide battle-tested patterns for building reliable LLM-powered applications:

- **[Autonomous Agent](agents/autonomous-agent/)**: Self-directed agents that can plan and execute tasks
- **[Evaluator-Optimizer](agents/evaluator-optimizer/)**: Agents that evaluate and improve their own outputs
- **[Orchestrator-Workers](agents/orchestrator-workers/)**: Coordinated multi-agent systems for complex tasks
- **[Parallelization](agents/parallelization/)**: Techniques for running multiple agents in parallel
- **[Prompt Chaining](agents/prompt-chaining/)**: Methods for breaking down complex tasks into subtasks
- **[Routing](agents/routing/)**: Smart routing of requests to specialized agents

### Prompting Techniques

Advanced techniques to improve your LLM's performance:

- **Chain of Thought**: Break down complex reasoning tasks into step-by-step thinking
  - Step-by-step reasoning
  - Transparent decision-making
  - Improved accuracy on complex tasks

- **Tree of Thoughts**: Explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously
  - Parallel exploration of solutions
  - Dynamic path evaluation
  - Better handling of complex problems

### Architecture Patterns

Scalable patterns for building robust LLM applications:

- **Modular Design**
  - Separation of concerns
  - Reusable components
  - Easy maintenance and testing

- **Scalable Processing**
  - Efficient resource utilization
  - Parallel execution
  - Load balancing

- **Monitoring & Evaluation**
  - Performance tracking
  - Quality assurance
  - Continuous improvement
