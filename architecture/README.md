# LLM Architecture Patterns

This directory contains architectural patterns and best practices for building scalable and maintainable LLM applications.

## Core Patterns

### 1. Modular Design
- [Modular Design Pattern](modular-design.md)
  - Component-based architecture
  - Service isolation
  - Interface definitions
  - State management

### 2. Scalable Processing
- [Scalable Processing Pattern](scalable-processing.md)
  - Queue-based processing
  - Load balancing
  - Caching strategies
  - Rate limiting
  - Batch processing

### 3. Monitoring & Evaluation
- [Monitoring Pattern](monitoring.md)
  - Performance metrics
  - Quality assurance
  - Error tracking
  - Cost optimization
  - Usage analytics

## Implementation Guidelines

Each pattern documentation includes:
- Architecture diagrams
- Component interactions
- Implementation examples
- Best practices
- Common pitfalls
- Performance considerations
- Scaling strategies

## Getting Started

1. Review the pattern documentation
2. Choose patterns that match your requirements
3. Follow implementation guidelines
4. Monitor and optimize performance

## Best Practices

- Start with simple implementations
- Add complexity only when needed
- Focus on maintainability
- Plan for scale from the start
- Implement comprehensive monitoring
- Document architectural decisions
