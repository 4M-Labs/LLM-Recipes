# LLM Architecture

Explore common architectural patterns for building robust and scalable LLM-powered applications.

## Self-Attention Pattern

The Self-Attention pattern is a fundamental architecture where the model processes input by relating different positions of a sequence to compute a representation of the sequence.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Input] --> B[Self-Attention]
    B --> C[Output]
    
    style A fill:#4285f4,stroke:#4285f4,color:white
    style B fill:#4285f4,stroke:#4285f4,color:white
    style C fill:#4285f4,stroke:#4285f4,color:white
```

### Key Components:
- Input: Initial sequence or tokens
- Self-Attention: Mechanism to weigh importance of different parts
- Output: Contextualized representation

## Decoder Pattern

The Decoder pattern processes input sequentially to generate output, commonly used in text generation tasks.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Input] --> B[Decoder]
    B --> C[Output]
    
    style A fill:#34A853,stroke:#34A853,color:white
    style B fill:#34A853,stroke:#34A853,color:white
    style C fill:#34A853,stroke:#34A853,color:white
```

### Key Components:
- Input: Prompt or context
- Decoder: Sequential processing unit
- Output: Generated text or completion

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Model Selection**
   - Choose appropriate model size
   - Consider computational requirements
   - Balance quality vs performance

2. **Optimization**
   - Implement caching mechanisms
   - Use batching where possible
   - Consider quantization

3. **Scalability**
   - Design for horizontal scaling
   - Implement proper load balancing
   - Monitor resource usage

4. **Maintenance**
   - Regular model updates
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error handling and logging
