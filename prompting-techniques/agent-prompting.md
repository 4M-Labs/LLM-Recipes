# Agent Prompting

Agent prompting is an advanced technique that enables LLMs to act as autonomous or semi-autonomous agents that can perform complex tasks through a combination of reasoning, planning, and tool use. This approach allows models to tackle multi-step problems that would be difficult to solve with a single prompt.

## How It Works

In agent prompting, you:
- Define the agent's capabilities and constraints
- Provide access to tools the agent can use
- Allow the agent to plan and execute steps toward a goal
- Enable the agent to reflect on its progress and adjust its approach

## Types of Agentic Systems

According to Anthropic's research, there are two main architectural approaches to agentic systems:

### 1. Workflows

Workflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths. These are more structured and predictable, making them suitable for well-defined tasks.

```javascript
import { generateText } from 'ai';

// Example of a simple workflow for customer support
async function customerSupportWorkflow(query) {
  // Step 1: Classify the query type
  const classification = await generateText({
    model: yourModel,
    system: "You are a query classifier. Categorize the following customer query as one of: 'refund', 'technical_issue', 'product_info', or 'other'.",
    prompt: query,
  });
  
  // Step 2: Route to appropriate handler based on classification
  let response;
  if (classification.includes('refund')) {
    response = await handleRefundQuery(query);
  } else if (classification.includes('technical_issue')) {
    response = await handleTechnicalIssue(query);
  } else if (classification.includes('product_info')) {
    response = await handleProductInfo(query);
  } else {
    response = await handleGeneralQuery(query);
  }
  
  return response;
}
```

### 2. Autonomous Agents

Autonomous agents are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.

```javascript
import { streamText } from 'ai';

// Example of a simple autonomous agent for research
async function researchAgent(topic) {
  // Initial planning phase
  const planStream = await streamText({
    model: yourModel,
    system: `You are a research assistant that plans and executes research on topics. 
    You have access to search tools and can summarize information.
    First, create a research plan with specific steps.
    Then, execute each step, using tools when necessary.
    Finally, synthesize your findings into a comprehensive report.`,
    prompt: `I need to research the following topic: ${topic}. Please help me gather and organize information about it.`,
  });
  
  let plan = '';
  for await (const chunk of planStream) {
    plan += chunk;
  }
  
  // Execute the plan (simplified for example)
  // In a real implementation, this would involve tool use, multiple steps, etc.
  const executionResult = await executeResearchPlan(plan, topic);
  
  // Synthesize findings
  const report = await generateText({
    model: yourModel,
    system: "You are a research assistant that synthesizes information into clear, comprehensive reports.",
    prompt: `Based on the following research findings, create a well-organized report on ${topic}:\n\n${executionResult}`,
  });
  
  return report;
}
```

## Common Agent Patterns

Based on Anthropic's research, these are effective patterns for building agents:

### 1. Prompt Chaining

Breaking complex tasks into sequential steps, with each LLM call processing the output of the previous one.

### 2. Routing

Classifying inputs and directing them to specialized handlers.

### 3. Parallelization

Either breaking tasks into independent subtasks (sectioning) or running the same task multiple times (voting).

### 4. Orchestrator-Workers

A central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results.

### 5. Evaluator-Optimizer

One LLM generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop.

## Using the Vercel AI SDK

```javascript
import { streamText } from 'ai';

// Example of an agent that can use tools
async function codeReviewAgent(codeSnippet) {
  const stream = await streamText({
    model: yourModel,
    system: `You are a code review agent that analyzes code for bugs, security issues, and performance problems.
    Follow these steps:
    1. Analyze the code structure and identify its purpose
    2. Check for syntax errors and bugs
    3. Identify security vulnerabilities
    4. Look for performance optimizations
    5. Provide a summary of findings with specific recommendations
    
    Be thorough and specific in your analysis.`,
    prompt: `Please review the following code snippet:\n\n${codeSnippet}`,
  });
  
  return stream;
}
```

## Best Practices from Anthropic

1. **Maintain simplicity** in your agent's design
2. **Prioritize transparency** by explicitly showing the agent's planning steps
3. **Carefully craft your agent-computer interface** through thorough tool documentation and testing
4. **Start with the simplest solution** and only increase complexity when needed
5. **Validate intermediate outputs** when possible
6. **Provide clear instructions** at each step
7. **Consider error handling** for when a step fails

## When to Use

Agent prompting is particularly effective for:
- Complex tasks requiring multiple steps and different types of reasoning
- Situations where the exact path to the solution isn't known in advance
- Tasks that benefit from tool use (search, calculations, code execution)
- Problems that require planning and adaptation
- Applications where autonomous operation is valuable

## Real-World Applications

According to Anthropic, these are particularly promising applications for AI agents:

1. **Customer support** - Combining conversation with access to customer data and actions
2. **Coding agents** - Solving software development tasks with verifiable outputs

## Limitations and Considerations

- Agents typically have higher latency and cost compared to simpler approaches
- There's potential for compounding errors across multiple steps
- Autonomous behavior requires careful testing and guardrails
- Not all tasks benefit from the added complexity of an agent approach
