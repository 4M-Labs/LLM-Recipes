# Self-Consistency Prompting

Self-consistency prompting is a technique that improves the reliability of LLM outputs by generating multiple independent reasoning paths for the same problem and then selecting the most consistent answer. This approach is particularly effective for tasks requiring complex reasoning, such as mathematical problem-solving or logical deduction.

## How It Works

In self-consistency prompting, you:
1. Generate multiple solutions to the same problem using different reasoning paths
2. Identify the most common answer across these solutions
3. Select this majority answer as the final output

This technique leverages the wisdom of crowds principle within a single model, reducing the impact of individual reasoning errors.

## Example

```javascript
import { generateText } from 'ai';

async function selfConsistencyPrompt(problem, numPaths = 5) {
  const solutions = [];
  
  // Generate multiple reasoning paths
  for (let i = 0; i < numPaths; i++) {
    const solution = await generateText({
      model: yourModel,
      system: "You are a problem solver that thinks step by step. Show your reasoning clearly.",
      prompt: `${problem}\n\nThink through this problem step by step to find the answer. Use a different approach than you might have used before.`,
      temperature: 0.7, // Higher temperature for diverse reasoning paths
    });
    
    solutions.push(solution);
  }
  
  // Extract answers from each solution
  const answers = solutions.map(extractAnswer);
  
  // Find the most common answer
  const finalAnswer = findMostCommonElement(answers);
  
  return {
    finalAnswer,
    solutions,
    confidence: calculateConfidence(answers, finalAnswer)
  };
}

// Helper function to extract the final answer from a solution
function extractAnswer(solution) {
  // This is a simplified implementation
  // In practice, you would use more robust parsing based on your specific format
  const lines = solution.split('\n');
  const lastLine = lines[lines.length - 1];
  
  // Look for patterns like "The answer is X" or "Therefore, X"
  const match = lastLine.match(/(?:answer is|therefore,?)\s*(\S+)/i);
  return match ? match[1] : lastLine;
}

// Helper function to find the most common element in an array
function findMostCommonElement(arr) {
  const counts = {};
  let maxCount = 0;
  let maxElement;
  
  for (const element of arr) {
    counts[element] = (counts[element] || 0) + 1;
    if (counts[element] > maxCount) {
      maxCount = counts[element];
      maxElement = element;
    }
  }
  
  return maxElement;
}

// Helper function to calculate confidence based on agreement
function calculateConfidence(answers, mostCommon) {
  const agreementCount = answers.filter(a => a === mostCommon).length;
  return agreementCount / answers.length;
}
```

## Using the Vercel AI SDK

```javascript
import { generateText } from 'ai';

async function solveWithSelfConsistency(problem, numPaths = 5) {
  // Generate multiple reasoning paths in parallel
  const solutionPromises = Array(numPaths).fill(0).map(() => 
    generateText({
      model: yourModel,
      system: "You are a problem solver that thinks step by step. Show your reasoning clearly.",
      prompt: `${problem}\n\nThink through this problem step by step to find the answer.`,
      temperature: 0.7, // Higher temperature for diverse reasoning paths
    })
  );
  
  const solutions = await Promise.all(solutionPromises);
  
  // Now, use another LLM call to analyze the solutions and find the most consistent answer
  const analysis = await generateText({
    model: yourModel,
    system: "You are an evaluator that analyzes multiple solutions to the same problem and determines the most consistent answer.",
    prompt: `
      I have generated ${numPaths} different solutions to the following problem:
      
      Problem: ${problem}
      
      Solutions:
      ${solutions.map((sol, i) => `Solution ${i+1}:\n${sol}\n`).join('\n')}
      
      Please analyze these solutions and:
      1. Extract the final answer from each solution
      2. Determine which answer appears most frequently
      3. Provide that as the final answer
      4. Calculate a confidence score based on the consistency of the answers
      
      Format your response as:
      Final Answer: [the most consistent answer]
      Confidence: [percentage of solutions that agree]
      Explanation: [brief explanation of why this answer is most likely correct]
    `,
  });
  
  return analysis;
}
```

## Advanced Applications

### Ensemble Reasoning

Combine self-consistency with different prompting techniques:

```javascript
async function ensembleReasoning(problem) {
  // Generate solutions using different prompting techniques
  const [zeroShotSolution, fewShotSolution, cotSolution] = await Promise.all([
    generateWithZeroShot(problem),
    generateWithFewShot(problem),
    generateWithChainOfThought(problem)
  ]);
  
  // For each technique, generate multiple paths
  const zeroShotPaths = await generateMultiplePaths(zeroShotSolution, 3);
  const fewShotPaths = await generateMultiplePaths(fewShotSolution, 3);
  const cotPaths = await generateMultiplePaths(cotSolution, 3);
  
  // Combine all paths
  const allPaths = [...zeroShotPaths, ...fewShotPaths, ...cotPaths];
  
  // Find the most consistent answer
  const answers = allPaths.map(extractAnswer);
  const finalAnswer = findMostCommonElement(answers);
  
  return finalAnswer;
}
```

### Verification Through Self-Consistency

Use self-consistency to verify answers:

```javascript
async function verifyWithSelfConsistency(problem, initialAnswer, numVerifications = 3) {
  // Generate verification attempts
  const verifications = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < numVerifications; i++) {
    const verification = await generateText({
      model: yourModel,
      system: "You are a careful verifier that checks whether a proposed answer to a problem is correct.",
      prompt: `
        Problem: ${problem}
        Proposed Answer: ${initialAnswer}
        
        Verify whether this answer is correct by solving the problem independently.
        Show your work step by step, and conclude with whether you agree or disagree with the proposed answer.
      `,
    });
    
    verifications.push(verification);
  }
  
  // Extract agreement/disagreement
  const agreements = verifications.map(v => 
    v.toLowerCase().includes('agree') ? 'agree' : 'disagree'
  );
  
  // Calculate confidence
  const agreementCount = agreements.filter(a => a === 'agree').length;
  const confidence = agreementCount / numVerifications;
  
  return {
    isVerified: confidence >= 0.5,
    confidence,
    verifications
  };
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use a sufficient number of paths** (typically 5-10) for reliable results
2. **Increase temperature** to encourage diverse reasoning approaches
3. **Implement robust answer extraction** tailored to your specific task
4. **Consider the computational cost** of generating multiple solutions
5. **Combine with other techniques** like Chain-of-Thought for best results
6. **Report confidence scores** based on the consistency of answers

## When to Use

- Mathematical problem-solving
- Logical reasoning tasks
- Multiple-choice questions
- Tasks where reasoning errors are common
